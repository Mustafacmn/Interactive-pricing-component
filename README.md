## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this challange. I learned how to create range slider, how to style it and it's thumb with css  and create a following track with js.

```css
.slider::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
}
```
```js
let color = 'linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(174, 77%, 80%)'+ value + '%, rgb(214,214,214)' + value + '%)';
  slider1.style.background = color;
```

### Continued development

I realised that my html css skills is not enough. I will pick projects that have more layout challanges and I will improve my css skills.
